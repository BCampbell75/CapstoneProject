## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
Year1 <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/BCamp/Desktop/Capstone Project/DataYear1_v2.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

#Normalize the data, and run correlation for all variables vs. Bankruptcy Outcome
normalize <- function(x) {
               return ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))) }
Year1.Norm <- prc_n <- as.data.frame(lapply(Year1[1:63], normalize))
cor(Year1.Norm, Year1$Bankruptcy.Outcome)
```

```{r}
#Use GLM to use P-value to validate the importance of teh variables. 
library(mlbench)
sum(Year1.Norm$Bankruptcy.Outcome)
fit_glm = glm(Bankruptcy.Outcome~., data = Year1.Norm, family = "binomial")
summary(fit_glm)
```
```{r}
library(caret)
install.packages("randomForest")
library(randomForest)
fit_rf = randomForest(Bankruptcy.Outcome~., data=Year1.Norm)
importance(fit_rf)
```
